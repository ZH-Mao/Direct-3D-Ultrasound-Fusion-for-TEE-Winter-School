# Direct-3D-Ultrasound-Fusion-for-TEE-Winter-School
This repository include codes for IEEE-UTS Winter School-2021

Project step: The participants will be asked to complete the following exploration steps based on the provided materials (ECG-gated 3D TEE data*, designated software, codes, etc.)

1. Image registration (intensity-based methods):
In this step, participants will implement an intensity-based image registration algorithm or use designated software to estimate transformation matrices (relative poses) between image frames.

2. Image Fusion:
In this step, participants will learn to use some basic methods to composite the aligned images.

3. Panoramic image reconstruction:
In this step, participants will learn to use a sequential strategy to register and fuse a sequence of 3D TEE images. In the end, a panoramic image with a larger FoV than the original single volume will be reconstructed.

4. Evaluation:
In this step, participants will learn to use some estimation metrics such as Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), Average surface distance (ASD) to evaluate the accuracy of the registration.
